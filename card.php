           <strong>Software Engineering Quizzes, Questions & Answers</strong>

           “Software” is the generic name given to all the instructions that make computers work; and “Software Engineering” is the study of how software is designed, developed and maintained. Do you know how many different software languages are currently in use? The answer is over 2000… and that’s just the high-level languages. Java is one of the most popular…but do you know why it’s called Java?

Get yourself a cup of coffee, take our quiz and you will find out! How about when things go wrong? One error in a single line of code in an AT&T computer caused a network collapse in which 75 million phone calls went unanswered. Our Software Engineering quizzes pose a variety of questions which will both test your knowledge and educate you about this crucial discipline which lies behind so much of our modern life.
