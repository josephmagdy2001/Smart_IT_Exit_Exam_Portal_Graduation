a computerized system. The system will allow students to register and take the exam. It also enables lecturers to make tests and assign it to a link or group. The system has several functions. Both students and instructors have to register before using the system. The Instructor can add questions, take tests, and assign it. The instructor also can get a list of all students who take the exam and their grades.
